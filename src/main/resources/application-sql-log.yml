#   The simplest way to dump the queries to standard out is to add the following to application.properties:
    show-sql: true
    properties:
      hibernate:
        generate_statistics: true
#        To beautify or pretty print the SQL, we can add:
        format_sql: true
#          While this is extremely simple, it's not recommended, as it directly unloads everything to standard output without any optimizations of a logging framework.
